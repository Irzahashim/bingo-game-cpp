This is a **console-based Bingo game** made in C++ as a **first semester group project**.

## Project Files
- `final project bingo game fa25-bcs-(008, 140, 152).cpp` → Main C++ code
- `final project flowchart and report (bingo game) fa25-bcs-(008, 140, 152).pdf` → Project report and flowchart

## Features
- 2-player console-based game
- 5x5 Bingo board
- Random number marking
- Lines counting (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- Win condition: first player to complete 5 lines

## Concepts Used
- Loops (`for` loops)
- Arrays (2D arrays)
- Conditional statements (`if`/`else`)
- Functions
- Boolean arrays for marking

## How to Run
1. Compile the `.cpp` file using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, CodeBlocks, Visual Studio).  
2. Run the program in console.  
3. Enter 5x5 numbers for both players.  
4. Take turns calling numbers until one player completes 5 lines.
